      Born and raised in the Comox Valley, Kyle Griffin (right) started Griffin
      Painting over fifteen years ago. What started as a summer business he has
      grown into one of Vancouver Island's most well respected painting
      business'. When he is not painting, Kyle is passionate about spending time
      with his wife and two sons, surfing, and travelling. <br><br>


      Phil Cheevers (left) partnered with Kyle to expand the business and meet the growing demand from happy clients. Born in Vancouver but living in Victoria for the past 20 years, Phil has a history in the business world but no desire to sit behind a desk. While he is not painting, he's also hanging out with his wife and two sons (almost identical ages to Kyle's), kiteboarding, travelling, as well as running a business in Mexico.

          After looking for help to restore our 1907 character house for 2
          years, we noticed their work on a similar house nearby. We contacted
          Griffin Painting - their price was extremely competitive and their
          detailed vision for restoring our house was exactly what we needed. We
          could not be happier with the paint job Griffin Painting did on our
          home.

          From the very beginning Griffin Painting was a pleasure to deal with.
          We got our Quote very quickly and it was clearly outlined what the job
          would entail. We had great communication with Kyle and Allan; they
          were always very professional. When it came time to do the job they
          were very efficient, and they got the job done very quickly without
          cutting any corners. We also appreciate the last minute suggestions
          they made which improved the final look of our house. We do not
          hesitate to recommend Griffin Painting.
