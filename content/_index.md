    desc: Born and Raised in the Comox Valley, Kyle Griffin began in the industry
      over twenty years ago and has been operating Griffin Painting for more
      than fifteen years. What started as a summer business to pay for
      University has now turned into one of Vancouver Island’s most well
      respected businesses’. Kyle is very passionate about painting.  He strives
      to find the most efficient, least impactful way to complete every project,
      no matter how complex, while using his wealth of experience to choose the
      best coating for every application.  In his free time he enjoys spending

    cta: Call To Action
    desc: Born and raised in the Comox Valley, Allan started his career as a red
      seal electrician, but took time away from the electrical world in the
      summers to paint with Kyle in the early days. Electrical work took him to
      multiple provinces in Canada, and provided opportunities to work with
      national institutions such as Via Rail as an Operations Manager for
      equipment maintenance and municipalities like the Town of Qualicum Beach
      as a Parks Superintendent, but his heart was in the Comox Valley. As a new
      father of twin boys and husband to his amazing wife, Allan's roots pulled
      his family back to his home turf to pursue an opportunity to work with his
      life long friend Kyle to help manage the growing business.<br><br>

          “We have had many painters over the decades and none have been as
          wonderful, professional and friendly as Kyle and team at Griffin. They
          did two of our entire homes (inside and outside), they also did a
          neighbours large oceanfront home, and a friends large commercial
          vacation business. They do top quality work, show up on time, very
          thoughtful and have always worked around our schedule. The product
          knowledge on paint, and applications to ensure the best performance on
          the West Coast was unparalleled. Highly recommend them! Worth the
          investment. Five star service.”

          From the very beginning Griffin Painting was a pleasure to deal with.
          We got our Quote very quickly and it was clearly outlined what the job
          would entail. We had great communication with Kyle and Allan; they
          were always very professional. When it came time to do the job they
          were very efficient, and they got the job done very quickly without
          cutting any corners. We also appreciate the last minute suggestions
          they made which improved the final look of our house. We do not
          hesitate to recommend Griffin Painting.
