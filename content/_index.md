      Born and raised in the Comox Valley, Kyle Griffin (right) started Griffin
      Painting over fifteen years ago. What started as a summer business he has
      grown into one of Vancouver Island's most well respected painting
      business'. When he is not painting, Kyle is passionate about spending time
      with his wife and two sons, surfing, and travelling. <br><br>


      Phil Cheevers (left) partnered with Kyle to expand the business and meet the growing demand from happy clients. Born in Vancouver but living in Victoria for the past 20 years, Phil has a history in the business world but no desire to sit behind a desk. While he is not painting, he's also hanging out with his wife and two sons (almost identical ages to Kyle's), kiteboarding, travelling, as well as running a business in Mexico.

        desc: Finely Tuned Technologies (FTT) was referred to me many, many years ago. I
          needed to calibrate my Media Room projector and my surround sound
          system. It quickly became evident that Richard was an expert in his
          field, a stickler for detail and exactness which is truly hard to find
          these days. Richard has always responded to my electronics needs in
          the most professional and expeditious way. I recently had FTT install
          a 'Smart Home' system throughout my house that controls security
          cameras, music, lights, heating and leak detection. Richard installed
          all the Smart Home equipment to his usual exacting standard and I am
          very pleased with the result. I highly recommend the services of
          Finely Tuned Technologies.

          provided. You have a solid crew, you guys leave the job cleaner than
          when you got there and I can see why you are known as the authority
          out here in the Greater Vancouver Area. Your expertise and above and
          beyond attitude combined with your high level of attention to detail
          is a hard quality to find and its appreciated!

          I recently had a voice activated home automation system installed by
          Richard Stokes @ Finely Tuned Technologies. As with his A/V and home
          theatre skills (which I have used for 15 yrs) Richard displays
          thorough knowledge and ability with his subject. His services are
          timely, efficient and unparalleled , and he is readily available for
          any queries before and after services = impeccable.  I would have no
          hesitation in recommending him for your needs.

          I recently had Richard Stokes (Finely Tuned Technologies) adjust and
          upgrade my home theatre. It was a pleasure to watch him work –
          relentless at getting everything as perfect as possible. I had the
          system upgraded to high definition and WOW what a difference. It feels
          like you could walk into the picture, as it is so real now. Thank you,
          Richard, for all your care and expertise and providing a
          movie-watching experience that is second to none.
