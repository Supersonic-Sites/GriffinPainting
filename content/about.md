    desc: Born and Raised in the Comox Valley, Kyle Griffin began in the industry
      over twenty years ago and has been operating Griffin Painting for more
      than fifteen years. What started as a summer business to pay for
      University has now turned into one of Vancouver Island’s most well
      respected businesses’. Kyle is very passionate about painting.  He strives
      to find the most efficient, least impactful way to complete every project,
      no matter how complex, while using his wealth of experience to choose the
      best coating for every application.  In his free time he enjoys spending
      time with his wife and two sons, surfing and travelling.<br><br>

    desc: Phil Cheevers partnered with Kyle to expand the business and meet the
      growing demand from happy clients. Born in Vancouver but living in
      Victoria for the past 20 years, Phil has a history in the business world
      but no desire to sit behind a desk. While he is not painting, he's also
      hanging out with his wife and two sons (almost identical ages to Kyle's),
      kiteboarding, travelling, as well as running a business in Mexico.<br><br>

    desc: Born and raised in the Comox Valley, Allan started his career as a red
      seal electrician, but took time away from the electrical world in the
      summers to paint with Kyle in the early days. Electrical work took him to
      multiple provinces in Canada, and provided opportunities to work with
      national institutions such as Via Rail as an Operations Manager for
      equipment maintenance and municipalities like the Town of Qualicum Beach
      as a Parks Superintendent, but his heart was in the Comox Valley. As a new
      father of twin boys and husband to his amazing wife, Allan's roots pulled
      his family back to his home turf to pursue an opportunity to work with his
      life long friend Kyle to help manage the growing business.<br><br>
