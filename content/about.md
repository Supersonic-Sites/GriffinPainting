      Born and raised in the Comox Valley, Kyle Griffin (right) started Griffin
      Painting over fifteen years ago. What started as a summer business he has
      grown into one of Vancouver Island's most well respected painting
      business'. When he is not painting, Kyle is passionate about spending time
      with his wife and two sons, surfing, and travelling. <br><br>


      Phil Cheevers (left) partnered with Kyle to expand the business and meet the growing demand from happy clients. Born in Vancouver but living in Victoria for the past 20 years, Phil has a history in the business world but no desire to sit behind a desk. While he is not painting, he's also hanging out with his wife and two sons (almost identical ages to Kyle's), kiteboarding, travelling, as well as running a business in Mexico.
